<a href="kaggle datasets download -d saadharoon27/diwali-sales-dataset"> Diwali Sale Dataset </a>
<br>
My goal was to understand and explore the functionalities of python data analytics libraries.
<br>
The data contained null values hence I first cleaned the dataset, changed the column datatype, renamed a few columns, and replaced the values inside a few columns. I created a new column called state_id which was necessary in order to create a geographic map in output.

There are 2 important file in this repository. 
<li>
  <ol>1) p2.ipynb - This contains my Python code for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.</ol>
  <ol>2) state_india.geojson - This will be necessary in order to print the output of the final question.</ol>
</li>
