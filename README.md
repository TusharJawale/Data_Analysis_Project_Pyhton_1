kaggle datasets download -d saadharoon27/diwali-sales-dataset

My goal was to understand and explore the functionalities of python data analytics libraries.
<br>
The data contained null values hence I first cleaned the dataset, changed the column datatype, renamed a few columns, and replaced the values inside a few columns. I created a new column called state_id which was necessary in order to create a geographic map in output.
